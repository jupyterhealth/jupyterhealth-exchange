About JupyterHealth
-------------------

`JupyterHealth <https://jupyterhealth.org/>`_ is an open-source, modular platform that eliminates healthcare data silos by integrating real-time health data from wearables, IoT devices, mobile apps, and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) into a unified, secure, and AI-powered ecosystem. The platform addresses the critical challenge of fragmented health data by providing researchers and clinicians with powerful tools for data integration, analysis, and visualization.

About This Documentation
------------------------

This documentation focuses on deploying **JupyterHealth Exchange**, the core storage and authentication platform that enables secure, consent-based health data sharing across all JupyterHealth components.

**Target Audience**: Enterprise IT (infrastructure, security, networking), Research IT, Clinical Informatics, Compliance/Privacy, DevOps/SRE, Data Governance, and project leadership at academic medical centers.

**Purpose**: Provide a comprehensive playbook to stand up and operate the JupyterHealth Exchange Django web app in a production environment, with options for on-prem, containers, and managed cloud (AWS/Azure). This guide combines strategic context with tactical implementation details following healthcare IT best practices.

Why JupyterHealth Exchange?
---------------------------

Clinical research faces a fundamental challenge: researchers need real-world patient health data from personal devices, but there's no standardized, consent-aware infrastructure to facilitate this exchange.

JHE solves this by providing:

* **Patient-controlled data sharing** via explicit consent management
* **Device-agnostic collection** using Open mHealth standards
* **Healthcare interoperability** through FHIR R5 compliance
* **Privacy-first architecture** with granular consent controls
